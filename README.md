# SwiftyHue
Philips Hue SDK written in swift

Work in progress...

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

To integrate SwiftyHue into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
